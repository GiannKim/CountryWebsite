		  <p> South Korea’s most famous landmark, Gyeongbokgung Palace is the largest of five residences of the Joseon Dynasty found in Seoul. It was built in 1395 but destroyed by fire during the Imjin War in the 1590s. Sadly, the Palace was left abandoned for centuries until restoration work began during the reign of King Gojong (1852-1919). </p>

		  <p> A famous landmark in South Korea for all the wrong reasons, the Korean Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) marks the border between South Korea and North Korea, running along the 38th parallel. This stretch of no man’s land between the two countries is one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world. </p>
